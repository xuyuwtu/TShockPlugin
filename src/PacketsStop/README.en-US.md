# PacketsStop Packet interception

- author: 羽学
- source: [github](https://github.com/1242509682/PacketsStop/)
- The plugin source code comes from Shaosiming's visitor restriction plug-in, and its data packet processing method is made into an independent functional plugin.
- This is a Tshock server plugin mainly used for:
- Use the instruction to open the intercepting player packet  
- Before use, you must first give the default group permission【免拦截】 
- Then modify the configuration file to add the data package name and use /reload to reload  
- Enter 【/拦截 add name】 to assign players to a new【LJ Group】
- Blocks most available permissions and intercepts their packets.
